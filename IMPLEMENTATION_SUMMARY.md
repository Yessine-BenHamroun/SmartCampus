## 💡 Key Algorithms

### Quiz Grading:
```python
for each question:
    if student_answer == correct_answer:
        score += points
percentage = (score / max_score) * 100
passed = percentage >= passing_score
```

### Ranking:
```python
all_attempts = get_all_attempts()
sorted_attempts = sort_by_percentage(all_attempts)
rank = find_position(current_attempt, sorted_attempts)
```

### Warning System:
```python
if warnings_count >= max_warnings:
    invalidate_submission()
    score = 0
    status = 'invalidated'
```

### AI Grading Assistance:
```python
quiz_scores = get_student_quiz_scores()
avg_score = calculate_average(quiz_scores)
note = generate_assistance_note(avg_score)
```
