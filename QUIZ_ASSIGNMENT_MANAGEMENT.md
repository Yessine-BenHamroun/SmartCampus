## 6. Backend API Enhancements

### New Endpoint: `/api/courses/validate-code/`

**Purpose:** Validate Python code syntax without executing it

**Request:**
```json
{
  "code": "def hello():\n    print('Hello')"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "errors": [],
  "line_numbers": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "line_count": 2,
  "has_comments": false
}
```

**Features:**
- Uses Python's `ast.parse()` for accurate syntax checking
- Returns detailed error messages with line numbers
- No code execution (safe)
- Checks for code quality metrics

---

## 7. Code Validation Utility

### New File: `Learner/code_validator.py`
**Functions:**
- `validate_python_syntax(code)` - Validate Python syntax
- `get_syntax_highlighted_code(code, language)` - Generate HTML with syntax highlighting
- `check_code_quality(code)` - Basic code quality checks
- `safe_execute_code(code, test_input, timeout)` - Safely execute code (with restrictions)

**Uses:**
- Python's `ast` module for parsing
- Pygments for syntax highlighting
- No external API dependencies

---

## 8. Enrollment Fix

### Backend: `courses/views.py` - `EnrollCourseView`
**Change:** Added instructor role check
- Instructors cannot enroll in courses
- Returns 403 Forbidden with clear error message
- Prevents confusion for instructor accounts

### Frontend: `course_detail.html`
**Change:** Conditional enrollment button
- Hides "Enroll" button for instructors
- Shows "Edit This Course" button if instructor owns the course
- Displays informational message for instructors viewing courses

---

## 9. Edit Course Enhancements

- **"Add Quiz" button** next to each lesson (lesson level)
- Improved lesson item layout for better UX

---

## 10. Dependencies Added

```
Pygments==2.17.2
```

**Purpose:** Syntax highlighting and code analysis (optional, has fallback)

---

## 11. URL Routes Added

### Learner App (`Learner/urls.py`)
```python
path('instructor/manage-quizzes/', views.manage_quizzes_view, name='manage_quizzes')
path('instructor/manage-assignments/', views.manage_assignments_view, name='manage_assignments')
path('instructor/submission/<str:submission_id>/grade/', views.grade_submission_view, name='grade_submission')
```

### Backend API (`backend/courses/urls.py`)
```python
path('validate-code/', validate_code_syntax, name='validate-code-syntax')
```

---

## 12. Views Added

### Learner App (`Learner/views.py`)
