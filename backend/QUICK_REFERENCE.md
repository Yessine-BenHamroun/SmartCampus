## Quick Explanation Points

### Quiz System

**What it does**: After completing a lesson, students can take an MCQ quiz to test their knowledge.

**How it works**:
1. Instructor creates quiz with multiple choice questions
2. Each question has 4 options and one correct answer (stored as index 0-3)
3. Student submits answers
4. System compares student's answers with correct answers
5. Calculates score and percentage
6. Shows instant results with ranking

**Key Function** (`views_quiz.py` line 120):
```python
# Loop through questions and check answers
for i, question in enumerate(quiz.questions):
    if student_answer['selected_answer'] == question['correct_answer']:
        score += points
```

### Assignment System

**What it does**: After completing all course lessons, students take a comprehensive assignment.

**Types**:
- **Coding**: Write code with time limit, no copy/paste
- **Written**: MCQ, true/false, short answer questions
- **Mixed**: Both coding and written

**Proctoring Features**:
- Tracks copy/paste attempts
- Tracks window switches
- 3 warnings = automatic fail (score 0)

**Key Function** (`views_assignment.py` line 140):
```python
# Check warnings
if warnings_count >= assignment.max_warnings:
    # Invalidate submission with score 0
    submission_data['status'] = 'invalidated'
```

### AI Generation

**What it does**: Helps instructors create quizzes and assignments automatically.

**How it works**:
1. Instructor clicks "Generate with AI"
2. System analyzes lesson/course content
3. Generates questions
4. Instructor reviews and edits
5. Creates quiz/assignment

**Current Status**: Placeholder implementation ready for OpenAI integration

**Key Function** (`ai_helpers.py` line 10):
```python
def generate_quiz_questions(lesson_content, num_questions, difficulty):
    # In production: Call OpenAI API
    # Currently: Returns sample questions
```

### Grading Assistance

**What it does**: Helps instructor grade assignments by analyzing student's quiz performance.

**How it works**:
1. When student submits assignment, system checks their quiz scores
2. Calculates average quiz performance
3. Provides note to instructor: "Student averaged 85% on quizzes - work likely authentic"
4. Instructor uses this context when grading

**Key Function** (`views_assignment.py` line 164):
```python
# Get student's quiz scores
for quiz in quizzes:
    attempts = QuizAttempt.find_by_student_quiz(student_id, quiz_id)
    quiz_attempts.append(best_attempt.percentage)

avg_quiz_score = sum(quiz_attempts) / len(quiz_attempts)
```

### Statistics Dashboard

**What instructors see**:
- Average score across all students
- Pass rate percentage
- Number of attempts per student
- Who validated (passed) and who didn't
- AI recommendations for improvement

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "average_score": 78.5,
  "pass_rate": 80.0,
  "student_attempts": [...],
  "ai_recommendations": [
    "Assignment difficulty appears appropriate",
    "Review student feedback to identify common challenges"
  ]
}
```

## Code Structure Explanation

### Why separate view files?

- `views_quiz.py` - All quiz-related logic
- `views_assignment.py` - All assignment-related logic
- `views_ai.py` - All AI generation logic
- Keeps code organized and easy to maintain

### Why use MongoDB models?

- Flexible schema for questions (different types)
- Easy to store arrays (questions, answers, warnings)
- Fast queries for statistics
- Matches existing project structure

### Why AI helpers in separate file?

- Easy to swap placeholder with real AI service
- Testable independently
- Reusable across different features

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How does ranking work?**
A: Get all attempts, sort by percentage descending, find position of current attempt.

**Q: How are warnings tracked?**
A: Frontend detects violations (copy/paste, window switch), sends count with submission. Backend checks if count >= max_warnings.

**Q: Can students retake quizzes?**
A: Yes, if max_attempts = 0 (unlimited) or they haven't reached the limit.

**Q: How is AI assistance calculated?**
A: System gets student's average quiz score in the course, provides context to instructor.

**Q: What happens if student gets 3 warnings?**
A: Submission automatically invalidated with score 0, marked as "invalidated" status.

**Q: Can instructor edit AI-generated content?**
A: Yes, AI generates suggestions, instructor reviews and edits before creating.

**Q: How does automatic grading work for assignments?**
A: Only quizzes are auto-graded (MCQ). Assignments require manual instructor grading.

**Q: What's the difference between Quiz and Assignment?**
A: 
- Quiz: After each lesson, auto-graded, instant results
- Assignment: After whole course, manually graded, more comprehensive
