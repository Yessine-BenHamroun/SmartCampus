async function enrollInCertification(certId) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `http://localhost:8001/api/certifications/${certId}/enroll/`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",

```python
# In views.py
cert_response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:8001/api/certifications/available/'
)
if cert_response.status_code == 200:
    cert_data = cert_response.json()
    all_certs = cert_data.get('certifications', [])
    # Filter for specific course
    certifications = [
        cert for cert in all_certs
        if cert.get('course_id') == course_id
    ]
```
